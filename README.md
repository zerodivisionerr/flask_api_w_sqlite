#Readme

##Purpose
This repository exists to show what I've learned from the course https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python.
Much thanks to Jose Salvatierra (https://github.com/schoolofcode-me), Megan Sanders, V Andrus, Zac Lewis, and
all others who have and continue to help me along this path. Whether directly or indirectly, I appreciate you all.

##Lessons Learned
- APIs are far less complicated than they first appear.
- Flask and Postman are great tools for sketching out an API, no matter how complex it may need to later become.
- Python has _still_ not shown me a single thing to complain about.
- Heroku needs better or more easily found documentation if it is going to be so strict about its requirements.
